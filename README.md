## Hi <img src="https://github.com/MvMukesh/MvMukesh/blob/main/Resume/Hi.gif" width="28px" height ="20px">

Iâ€™m an inquisitive learner passionate about leveraging the power of data and financial numbers to extract quintessential insights to solve real-world problemsâœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

<details>
During my stint in TechSim+ as a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Intern, I worked on identifying trends in the crypto market by analysing the cryptocurrency historical data based on seven core principles. This experience gave me an understanding of how businesses leverage data to make crucial trading market decisions.

To gain a broader perspective, I extended my knowledge by enrolling myself in Analytics Vidhya's ascend pro Master Data Science for the Industry program, certified
by KPMG in India & Analytics Vidhya(9month) where I performed data-driven, tactical analysis and created dashboards(KPI's) for an Indian based Poultry Farm by leveraging tools like MS Office, Tableau,Python and Machine Learning(Clustering). We a team of 3 proposed saving of 3% out of Poultry farm total spending of approx 22Billion.

These experiences motivated me to extend my knowledge and Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Science Intern with CloudyML which I believe is one of the rising star in Edtech industry, here at CloudyML I am  focusing on Computer Vision and in parallel making easy to follow Applied Tutorials related with Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My daily curriculum includes topics such as statistics and probability, business analytics, machine learning, computer vision and  optimization. I am also working on Customer Life Time values Problem, on this I have written two blogs along with applied code.  

My life outside of this involves solving the Rubikâ€™s Cube, reading and learning about businesses & finance and writing about general learning pitfalls which one can get into if not guided well.

Iâ€™m actively looking to build upon my experiences more solid and Iâ€™m currently seeking Full time opportunities as an entry-level Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
